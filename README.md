Writing about Aria di Rodi is difficult. 
How do you describe the surprise of the first time you opened that door? 
What is it like to find yourself in a small alley and suddenly in a large unexpected garden?

We always enjoy the wonder on our customers' faces when they arrive.

If you arrive during the day, the colors of the house, the garden, and the sunny Rhodian sky make you feel immediately on vacation.
Those who arrive in Aria di Rodi in the evening are being greeted by the scent of our historic Datura.
Even being close to the noise of the crowd, our garden and the house maintain a festive silence. This is part of the magic of staying in Aria di Rodi.
How to tell in a few lines the story of a house that has protected hundreds of people and made them dream, from the knights who built the foundations and the arched apartments, to the Turks who, with the very high ceilings on the first floor and the refined hammam, with its magical dome.
This house has protected us and made us dream, our family, our friends, and soon, we hope you do too.
Come to visit and enjoy this corner of paradise with us.
